# CSE 160 Program 5
# Solar System Exploration Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Solar System Exploration Project, a dynamic, interactive 3D visualization of our solar system. This project is designed to educate and inspire curiosity about the celestial bodies within our solar system. Leveraging the power of Three.js, a cross-browser JavaScript library/API used to create and display animated 3D graphics in a web browser, users can enjoy a detailed and immersive experience directly from their web browser.

## Features

- **Detailed 3D Models:** Explore high-quality, realistic 3D models of planets, moons, and the Sun, meticulously crafted for an authentic educational experience.
- **Interactive Navigation:** Seamlessly navigate through the solar system with intuitive controls. Zoom in on planets, orbit around them, and discover fascinating details at your own pace.
- **Educational Insights:** Click on any celestial body to reveal interesting facts, figures, and discoveries about it, enhancing your knowledge and appreciation of our solar system.
- **Dynamic Lighting and Textures:** Experience the beauty of the solar system with realistic lighting, shadows, and textures that bring these celestial bodies to life.
- **Easy Setup with Live Server:** Designed to be easily run on a local development server using Live Server, providing a real-time preview and speeding up the development process.

## Prerequisites

Before you embark on your journey through the solar system, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed and ready:

- **Node.js**: Required to run npm commands and install packages such as Live Server and Three.js.
- **A Modern Web Browser**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge for the best viewing experience.
- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**: Recommended for editing the project and running Live Server, though any IDE/text editor will suffice.

## Installation Guide

### Setting Up the Project

1. **Clone the repository** or download the project files to your local machine.
2. **Open the project folder** in VS Code or your preferred IDE.

### Installing Live Server (VS Code)

1. In VS Code, go to the Extensions view by clicking on the square icon on the sidebar or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`.
2. Search for "Live Server" and install it.
3. Once installed, you'll see a "Go Live" button at the bottom right of the VS Code window.

### Including Three.js

- **Option 1: Via CDN**
  - Add the following script tag to your HTML file:
    ```html
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/three/build/three.min.js"></script>
    ```
- **Option 2: npm Installation**
  - Run the following command in your project directory:
    ```
    npm install three
    ```

## Running the Project

With Live Server installed and Three.js included, you're ready to launch the project:

1. **Open `index.html` with Live Server**: Right-click on the `index.html` file in your project directory in VS Code and select "Open with Live Server". Alternatively, click the "Go Live" button at the bottom right.
2. **Explore the Solar System**: Your default web browser will automatically open and load the project. Begin your exploration!

## Development

This project was developed to demonstrate the capabilities of WebGL and Three.js in creating educational and engaging 3D visualizations. Through the interactive exploration of the solar system, users can gain a better understanding of planetary science and astronomy.
